How does the game work?

In this game, All the players are given a word by the operator except one player (who is the imposter)
The game starts with all players saying something related to the given word. The order of speaking is given by the operator.
The Players try to guess and identify who the imposter is. They can do so by calling for a vote.
The vote can only be called after the first round and requires atleast two players wanting to vote.
Every player has the right to justify themselves during the voting.
The one with the majority of votes will be considered the loser if he was the imposter,else everyone else loses and the imposter wins.
